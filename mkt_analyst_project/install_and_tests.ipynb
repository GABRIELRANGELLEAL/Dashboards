Recomendações\\n\\n### 💰 Alocação de Budget  \\n- **Investir mais em:**  \\n  - AD17 (LP02) e CTA BCP - 3 Erros mais comuns na campanha de Vendas Quentes, pela alta eficiência em CTR e CPC.  \\n- **Reduzir investimento em:**  \\n  - Campanhas e anúncios do grupo Vendas Frios, principalmente AD37 (LP02) e AD03, que apresentam altos custos e baixo desempenho.\\n\\n### 🧪 Testes A/B práticos  \\n- Testar variações do criativo da campanha CTA BCP - 3 Erros mais comuns para expandir alcance, mantendo a boa taxa de cliques.  \\n- Experimentar novos públicos dentro da segmentação \"VV Vidros até 05.25\" para melhorar a performance dos anúncios Frios, focando em microsegmentações e lookalikes.  \\n- Testar Landing Pages (LPs) alternativas para os ads com performance mediana (ex. AD04 e AD03 em Quentes) para otimizar conversão após clique.\\n\\n---\\n```', type='output_text', logprobs=[])], role='assistant', status='completed', type='message')], parallel_tool_calls=True, temperature=1.0, tool_choice='auto', tools=[], top_p=1.0, background=False, max_output_tokens=None, max_tool_calls=None, previous_response_id=None, prompt=None, prompt_cache_key=None, reasoning=Reasoning(effort=None, generate_summary=None, summary=None), safety_identifier=None, service_tier='default', status='completed', text=ResponseTextConfig(format=ResponseFormatText(type='text'), verbosity='medium'), top_logprobs=0, truncation='disabled', usage=ResponseUsage(input_tokens=1640, input_tokens_details=InputTokensDetails(cached_tokens=0), output_tokens=592, output_tokens_details=OutputTokensDetails(reasoning_tokens=0), total_tokens=2232), user=None, store=True)"
